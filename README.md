# Codsworth-like-AI
A Fallout's inspired AI assistant that can be used on Android and is responsive to both TTS (text-to-speech) and STT (speech-to-text).

Hello! I'm a huge fan of video games and as you can see, I love Fallout! I always wanted to have a Mr. Handy by my side, specially Cods... so that's why I'm creating an AI agent just like him!
That's my first ML project and the most complex so far. My main goal is to get as much knowledge as possible from this project while building a strong porfolio.

That's my first time creating an A.I, using APIs, importing it to Android and using certain libraries. I'm focusing on absorving knowledge and making sure I completely understand what each line of code does.
